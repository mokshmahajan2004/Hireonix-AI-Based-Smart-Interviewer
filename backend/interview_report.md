Question:  1. Can you tell us about your experience as a Frontend Developer and the projects you have worked on?

Answer: Absolutely! I have been a Frontend Developer for over five years and have worked on a variety of projects during that time. One of my most recent projects was for a company called Patrol Burke & Second. I was responsible for designing and developing the user interface for their new e-commerce platform. I used React and Redux for the frontend framework and integrated it with a RESTful API. I also implemented a responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox. As a result, the platform saw a 20% increase in user engagement and a 10% increase in sales. I'm proud of the work I did on this project and would be happy to discuss it further if you have any questions.
