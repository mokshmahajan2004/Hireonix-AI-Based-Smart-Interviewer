### Question 1
**Q:**  1. Can you tell us a little about your experience as a Backend Developer and the projects you have worked on?
**A:** 



---

### Question 2
**Q:** 2. What inspired you to specialize in backend development, and how has your journey been so far?
**A:**  The thing that inspired me to especially in backhand development is that I continue due to the fact that it uses logical thinking and I have to think about everything how it's going to scale in long term and how reliable my backhand will be if the number of users has been scaled up to 10,000 and all this stuff also I am solving all the logical part of it. Friend 10 is more about designing which I do not like that's why I turn towards backhand development.

 **Overall score: 50%**

**Question: 2. What inspired you to specialize in backend development, and how has your journey been so far? (20 points)**

* Answer: The thing that inspired me to specialize in backend development is that I enjoy the logical thinking it requires, and I have to consider how the backend will scale and be reliable with a growing number of users. I was not as interested in frontend design, which is why I turned towards backend development. (12 points)
* The answer is relevant but lacks structure and specific examples. The candidate could mention specific projects or experiences that influenced their decision to specialize in backend development. (8 points)

**Answer structure and formatting (10 points)**

* The answer is a run-on sentence that is difficult to read and understand. The candidate could improve their score by breaking up the answer into shorter sentences and adding punctuation. (4 points)

**Grammar, spelling, and syntax (10 points)**

* The answer contains several spelling and grammar errors, including "backhand" instead of "backend," "Friend 10" instead of "frontend," and "that's why I turn" instead of "that's why I turned." These errors make the answer difficult to understand and negatively impact the candidate's score. (7 points)

**Additional comments:**

* While the answer shows some enthusiasm for backend development, the lack of structure, specific examples, and grammar errors make it difficult to understand and negatively impact the candidate's score. The candidate could improve their score by practicing their writing skills and providing specific examples of their experiences with backend development.

**A:** 



---

### Question 4
**Q:** 4. Can you tell us more about your top 10 internship project at ELC, TIET, and how it contributed to your growth as a developer?
**A:**  Talking about the top 10 projects that in Dunshin project that I got at ELC, I made a driver drowsiness system, in the direction system in which the person is detected drowsy. If the person is detected drowsy, a hardwit art such as buzzer or seed vibrator turns on. For telling that person is drowsy or not, we have used three deep learning models and then in December that the three models were VGZ16, 19 and the dense net 121. Their output was then in December using concatenate method and we got accuracy of 89%.

 **Scores:**

* Clarity: 5/10
* Content: 6/10
* Grammar: 4/10
* Total: 15/30

Question: 4. Can you tell us more about your top 10 internship project at ELC, TIET, and how it contributed to your growth as a developer?
Answer:  Sure, I'd be happy to. One of the projects that I'm particularly proud of from my time at ELC was a driver drowsiness detection system for the direction system. This system uses a camera to detect if the driver is becoming drowsy, and if so, it activates a hardware alert such as a buzzer or seat vibrator. 

To detect drowsiness, we used three different deep learning models: VGG16, VGG19, and DenseNet 121. We then concatenated the outputs of these models to determine if the driver was drowsy or not. After training and testing, we were able to achieve an accuracy rate of 89%. 

This project allowed me to gain experience in several areas, including computer vision, deep learning, and hardware integration. It was a challenging project, but I'm proud of what we were able to achieve. The skills I developed during this project have been invaluable in my growth as a developer.

Question: 5. As a winner of Hackmol 5.0, NIT Jalandhar, can you share your experience and how you approached problem-solving in a team setting?

Answer:  The problem statement we worked on during Hackmol 5.0 at NIT Jalandhar was to create a personal finance management tool. In this tool, a user can make a UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transaction, and based on their risk appetite, a portion of the transaction amount is transferred to their investment portfolio. This investment portfolio is then used to invest in the stock market or cryptocurrencies. Our approach to problem-solving in a team setting involved effective communication, division of tasks based on team members' strengths, and regular brainstorming sessions to come up with innovative solutions. This approach helped us secure the winner position in the special track of Hackmol 5.2.

Answer: Sure, I have experience working with Firebase, Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. I have built two projects with Firebase, including this AI interviewer and a finance tracker. In the AI interviewer, I used Firebase to manage user authentication, real-time database, and hosting. The finance tracker allowed users to track their income and expenses, and I used Firebase for real-time data synchronization and offline support.

In addition, I have built a blog application using MongoDB, Express, and Node.js. The application allows users to sign up, write blogs, and view other users' blogs. I used MongoDB to store user information, blogs, and comments, and Express and Node.js to handle server-side logic and API requests.

Overall, I have gained valuable experience working with Firebase, Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, and I am confident in my ability to build scalable and reliable applications using these technologies.

```python
Scores: 
Content: 6/10
Clarity: 4/10
Grammar: 4/10
```
Feedback with improvements:

The content of the answer is partially correct as the candidate has mentioned some resources like Instagram influencers, GitHub, LinkedIn, and Medium. However, the answer lacks specificity, and it would be better if the candidate mentions particular sources or websites that they follow.

Regarding clarity, the answer is not clear, and the candidate should focus on making their answer more precise and concise. It would be helpful if the candidate directly mentions the resources they follow and how they help them stay updated.

Lastly, the grammar needs improvement, and the candidate should proofread their answer before submitting it to avoid grammatical errors. Here is an improved version of the answer:

"To stay updated with the latest trends and developments in backend development, I follow multiple resources and platforms. Firstly, I follow several Instagram influencers who share valuable insights and information about backend development. Secondly, I regularly check GitHub, which is an excellent platform to discover new applications and resources related to backend development. Additionally, I use LinkedIn to connect with other professionals and stay informed about the latest trends and technologies in the field. Lastly, I read Medium articles and blog posts that provide updates on new backend development tools and techniques."
